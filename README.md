## Initialization

MySQL connection settings can be edited in `php/config.php`

To create an empty database, you can source `mysql/init.sql`
To create a ready-to-go database, you can source `mysql/populate.sql`
To delete all data, you can source `mysql/drop.sql`

Alternative filling solution is using `php/fill_db.php`, but requires special web server mounting;

Webserver is to be mounted in the `pages` folder.
Due to lack of SMTP servers, the contact form does check user input but sends it back to the user so he can send it himself instead.

Passwords must contain one capital (ex. Paris, London...).
